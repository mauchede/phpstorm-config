Global configuration for PhpStorm

## Installation

Location of the PhpStorm folder is depending on OS and PhpStorm version. See section [Project and IDE settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/project-and-ide-settings.html) for more information about the configuration directory structure.

Linux users can use the [installer](https://github.com/mauchede/phpstorm-config/blob/master/bin/installer):

```sh
curl --location "https://github.com/mauchede/phpstorm-config/raw/master/bin/installer" | sh -s -- install
```

__Note__: Make sure PhpStorm is not running, or it will overwrite the changed files before shutting down.
